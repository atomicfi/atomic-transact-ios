### Changes

- Fixed a potential crash when closing sheets
- Dynamic package option is now available. Static is still the default.
    - `AtomicTransact-Dynamic.xcframework` and `QuantumIOS-Dynamic.xcframework` are now available on releases for manual linking if needed. `MuppetIOS.xcframework` is also still required. 
    - If using SPM and you need dynamic linking, switch to linking the `AtomicTransact-Dynamic` package into your project, rather than `AtomicTransact`.
    - All other usages remain the same
